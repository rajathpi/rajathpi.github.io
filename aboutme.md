## ACADEMIC PROJECTS

- #### [Automatic Medical Report Generation from Radiology Chest X-Ray using Deep Learning](https://github.com/rajathpi/automatic-report-generator)  
  Developed a predictive model using CNN (CheXNET for feature extraction), LSTM, and RNN to analyze frontal and lateral chest X-ray images and generate medical reports through text processing.

- #### [Scattering Parameters Parameterization](https://github.com/rajathpi/Scattering-parameter-parameterization)  
  Leveraged TensorFlow and Keras to implement neural networks (Basic, LSTM, and GRU) for predicting input parameters in a human head-antenna system based on scattering parameters. The GRU model outperformed others, demonstrating high accuracy.

- #### Face Anti-Spoofing  
  Designed a face anti-spoofing model using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to extract features from images. Implemented a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to accurately determine whether a face is real or fake.

- #### [AI Learns to Play Flappy Bird](https://github.com/rajathpi/flappy-bird)  
  Trained an agent to play a Flappy Bird clone using neuroevolution of augmenting topologies. Both the game environment and AI were built entirely in Python.

- #### [Health First App](https://github.com/rajathpi/health-first)  
  Created an Android app that provides detailed information about food items, their health benefits, and the diseases they can help prevent.
