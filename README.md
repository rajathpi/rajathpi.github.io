## ACADEMIC PROJECTS

- #### [Automatic Medical Report Generation from Radiology Chest X-Ray using Deep learning Strategy](https://github.com/rajathpi/automatic-report-generator)
Using CNN, the CheXNET model for feature extraction, LSTM, and RNN to build a predictive model that involves frontal and lateral chest Xray images and text processing to build a deep learning model.

- #### FaceAntiSpoofing 
Using HOG to find the magnitude and angle of each pixel so that we could extract features from the image. Implemented a Support Vector Machine, which is a classifier used to classify if the face is real or fake.

- #### [AI Learns to Play Flappy Bird](https://github.com/rajathpi/flappy-bird) 
Using neuroevolution of arguments topologies, trained an agent to play a clone of the game Flappy Bird. Both the game environment and AI are programmed using Python.

- #### [Health First App](https://github.com/rajathpi/health-first)
An android app that contains detailed information on the food items, the health benefits, and the diseases that can be prevented by the consumption of the specific food item.
